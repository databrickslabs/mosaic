## v0.4.3 [DBR 13.3 LTS]

- iPython dependency limited to "<8.11,>=7.4.2" for both DBR and keplergl-jupyter 
- Expanded support for fuse-based checkpointing (persisted raster storage), managed through:
  - spark config 'spark.databricks.labs.mosaic.raster.use.checkpoint' in addition to 'spark.databricks.labs.mosaic.raster.checkpoint'.
  - python: `mos.enable_gdal(spark, with_checkpoint_path=path)`.
  - scala: `MosaicGDAL.enableGDALWithCheckpoint(spark, path)`.

## v0.4.2 [DBR 13.3 LTS]
- Geopandas now fixed to "<0.14.4,>=0.14" due to conflict with minimum numpy version in geopandas 0.14.4.

- Streamlines setup_gdal and setup_fuse_install:
    - init script and resource copy logic fixed to repo "main" (.so) / "latest" (.jar).
    - added apt-get lock handling for native installs.
    - removed support for UbuntuGIS PPA as GDAL version no longer compatible with jammy default (3.4.x).

## v0.4.1 [DBR 13.3 LTS]
- Fixed python bindings for MosaicAnalyzer functions.
- Added tiller functions, ST_AsGeoJSONTile and ST_AsMVTTile, for creating GeoJSON and MVT tiles as aggregations of geometries.

- Raster tile metadata will contain driver, parentPath and path.
- Raster tile metadata will contain warnings and errors in case of failures.
- All raster functions ensure rasters are TILED and not STRIPED when appropriate.
- GDAL cache memory has been decreased to 512MB to reduce memory usage and competition with Spark.
- Add RST_MakeTiles that allows for different raster creations.
- Rasters can now be passed as file pointers using checkpoint location.

## v0.4.0 [DBR 13.3 LTS]
- First release for DBR 13.3 LTS which is Ubuntu Jammy and Spark 3.4.1. Not backwards compatible, meaning it will not run on prior DBRs; requires either a Photon DBR or a ML Runtime (__Standard, non-Photon DBR no longer allowed__).
- New `setup_fuse_install` function to meet various requirements arising with Unity Catalog + Shared Access clusters; removed the scala equivalent function, making artifact setup and install python-first for scala and Spark SQL. 
- Removed OSS ESRI Geometry API for 0.4 series, JTS now the only vector provider.
- MosaicAnalyzer functions now accept Spark DataFrames instead of MosaicFrame, which has been removed.
- Docs for 0.3.x have been archived and linked from current docs; notebooks for 0.3.x have been separated from current notebooks.
