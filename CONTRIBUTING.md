# Contributing to Mosaic

## Overview
We happily welcome contributions to Mosaic. 
We use GitHub Issues to track community reported issues and GitHub Pull Requests for accepting changes.

## Repository structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- `pom.xml` Mosaic project definition and dependencies 
- `src/` Scala source code and tests for Mosaic
- `python/` Source code for Python bindings
- `docs/` Source code for documentation
- `.github/workflows` CI definitions for Github Actions

## Test & build Mosaic

### Scala JAR

We use the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) build tool to manage and build the Mosaic scala project.

The Mosaic JAR including all dependencies can be generated by running: `mvn clean package`.
By default, this will also run the tests in `src/test/`.

The packaged JAR should be available in `target/`.

### Python bindings

The python bindings can be tested using [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
- Build the scala project and copy to the packaged JAR to the `python/mosaic/lib/` directory.
- Move to the `python/` directory and install the project and its dependencies:
    `pip install . && pip install pyspark==<project_spark_version>`
  (where 'project_spark_version' corresponds to the version of Spark 
  used for the target Databricks Runtime, e.g. `3.2.1`.
- Run the tests using `unittest`: `python -m unittest`

The project wheel file can be built with [build](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Install the build requirements: `pip install build wheel`.
- Build the wheel using `python -m build`.
- Collect the .whl file from `python/dist/`

### Documentation

The documentation has been produced using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

To build the docs:
- Install the pandoc library (follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)).
- Install the python requirements from `docs/docs-requirements.txt`.
- Build the HTML documentation by running `make html` from `docs/`.
- You can locally host the docs by running the `reload.py` script in the `docs/source/` directory.

## Style

Tools we use for code formatting and checking:
- `scalafmt` and `scalastyle` in the main scala project.
- `black` and `isort` for the python bindings.
