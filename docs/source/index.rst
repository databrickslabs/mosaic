Mosaic is an extension to the `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_ framework that allows easy and fast processing of very large geospatial datasets.

Mosaic provides:
   - easy conversion between common spatial data encodings (WKT, WKB and GeoJSON);
   - constructors to easily generate new geometries from Spark native data types;
   - many of the OGC SQL standard `ST_` functions implemented as Spark Expressions for transforming, aggregating and joining spatial datasets;
   - high performance through implementation of Spark code generation within the core Mosaic functions;
   - optimisations for performing point-in-polygon joins using an approach we co-developed with Ordnance Survey (`blog post <https://databricks.com/blog/2021/10/11/efficient-point-in-polygon-joins-via-pyspark-and-bng-geospatial-indexing.html>`_); and 
   - the choice of a Scala, SQL and Python API.
